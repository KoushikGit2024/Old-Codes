<h2>Future Projects</h2>
<p>
ISRO is developing and operationalising more powerful and less pollutive rocket engines so it can eventually develop much heavier rockets. It also plans to develop electric and nuclear propulsion for satellites and spacecrafts to reduce their weight and extend their service lives.Long-term plans may include crewed landings on Moon and other planets as well.
